<ul>
<li><p><strong>Survey:</strong> <a href="https://marcevanstein.typeform.com/to/lJXbE5">Fill out this survey!</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reading:</strong> <a href="Reading/Basics-Practical-Guide-to-Musical-Composition.pdf">&quot;Basics&quot; from <em>A Practical Guide to Musical Composition</em> by Alan Belkin</a>. Also, take the time to <a href="Reading/AudioExamples.html">listen here</a> to the audio of the repertoire examples he mentions. <strong>E-mail me a paragraph about 100-150 words in length</strong> describing your experience with the reading, along with any questions you have or concepts you did not understand <strong><em>by Sunday at 5PM</em></strong>.</p></li>
<li><strong>Sound Collecting:</strong> Find and bring to class <em>five</em> sounds that you could use as a musical instrument. You should either bring the sound-making object to class or make and e-mail me a recording of it to share with the class. Each sound must have at least one interesting parameter that you can vary, either discretely or continuously. (Finding continuous variation is harder!) Try to think outside of the box: can you find variation in parameters other than pitch and volume?</li>
