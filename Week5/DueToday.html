<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sound Recording Collection</strong>: Collect 8 recordings of sounds that you find interesting, either by recording them with your phone or portable recording device, or by downloading them from an online service such as <a href="https://freesound.org">freesound.org</a>. Try to have each recording contain just one single &quot;sound object&quot;, editing the files where necessary using a tool such as <em>Audacity</em>. Name each recording something simple that describes its contents, such as &quot;alarmclock.wav&quot;. <em>Place these sounds in a single folder with your name on it, compress the folder, and e-mail it to me as a downloadable link (e.g. from google drive, box, dropbox, wetransfer) by Tuesday at 5pm.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sound Categorization</strong>: Using <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week5/Listening%20Graph%20Templates/Scales.pdf">this template</a>, place each sound where you feel it belongs on the various scales given. For the last two, invent some properties of your own, such as &quot;sudden attack vs. gradual attack&quot; or &quot;stable vs. unstable&quot;.</p></li>
<li><strong>Rhythm and Meter Readings</strong>: Take a look at these resources in preparation for class. You do not need to send me a reading response.
<ul>
<li>Some <a href="http://dictionary.onmusic.org/appendix/topics/meters">basic terms about meter</a> that will be useful for us in discussion. This is likely review for some of you, but I'd like us all to be on the same page.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=HOvvAs5FILk">This video</a>, like 98% of videos on youtube, is a bit long-winded but it introduces the fascinating concept of rhythmic modulation, which we will discuss in class. It's okay if it's difficult to wrap your head around.</li>
