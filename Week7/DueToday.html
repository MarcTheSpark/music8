<ul>
<li><p><strong>Composition Assignment</strong>: Compose a 1-2 minute piece by arranging, duplicating, combining and processing the sounds from your sound collection assignment. You may use Audacity or a different program if you have facility in something else. Try to have the sounds interact with one another in a meaningful way, and make use of space as one of your main compositional parameters. Use most of, if not all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverb</li>
<li>Echo</li>
<li>Left right panning using volume</li>
<li>Left right panning using timing</li>
<li>EQ</li>
<li>Reverse</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, you can use the rhythm assignment from last week as a starting point for organizing the sounds in time. If you choose to do this, it might be useful to start by generating a click track for the subdivision pulse by selecting the menu item Generate &gt; Rhythm Track.</p>
<p>Turn in the assignment by 10pm on Tuesday evening by e-mailing me a rendering as an .ogg file.</p></li>
<li><strong>Start to think about what you might want to do for your final project.</strong> We will start to really look into this next week.</li>
