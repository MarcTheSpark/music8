<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Marc Evans(tein) <strong>E-mail Address:</strong> marc@marcevanstein.com <strong>Course Materials:</strong> <a href="http://marcevanstein.com/music8materials">marcevanstein.com/music8materials</a> <strong>Class Hours:</strong> Monday, 11:00am â€“ 12:30pm <strong>Office Hours:</strong> Monday, 2-3pm, Music 2230 or by appointment</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> What it means to be a composer has changed and expanded dramatically over the past century. Composers work with an ever-widening pallet of tools and materials to produce works that run the gamut from traditional looking scores, to interactive musical games, to meditations on the nature of sound. At the same time, boundaries between musical genres have softened, and composers are increasingly drawing on many different traditions of music-making. In Music 8 (Class Composition), we will explore this thrilling variety of paths and destinations, as students interact with new ideas and respond to them with their own musical creations.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> An open mind, and an inquisitive soul.</p>

<p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Familiarize students with the wide range of viewpoints and practices in contemporary music composition.</p></li>
<li><p>Give students hands-on experience composing music using a variety of tools and approaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop critical listening skills, and an understanding of what makes music tick.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The breakdown of grading will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Attendance and Participation</em> (30%): Showing up to class and engaging is a crucial part of the learning experience, and therefore represents a sizable portion of your grade.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Exercises and Reading Assignments</em> (40%): There will be two main types of assignments: composition exercises and reading assignments. The composition exercises are designed to introduce you to a variety of approaches to music composition, some of which may end up becoming instrumental to your final project. The reading assignments are generally short articles that help to introduce or give context to the topic we will cover that week. I will ask that you send me a short written response to the article of about 100-150 words by <em>Sunday at 5pm</em> the day before the class. This deadline will give me a sense before class of your experiences with the reading.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Final project</em> (30%): Over the second half of this term, each of you will develop a more substantial composition using tools and an aesthetic of your own choosing. More details will be given starting around week 5.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grading Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Late Assignments</em>: Assignments turned in late lose 20% of their value plus an additional 10% per week that they are late.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Attendance</em>: Each unexcused absence results in a deduction of 10% in the attendance grade, and each late arrival to class results in a deduction of 5% from the attendance grade. For an absence to be excused, you need to communicate the reason for the absence <em>prior</em> to the class that you are missing and provide a doctor's note or other evidence upon request. Extentuating circumstances will be considered.</p></li>
