<section>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Composing with pitch:</strong> Write a short piece for cello and piano in which the piano plays a sequence of chords and the cello plays a melodic line either above or below those chords. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to the interval structure of the chords. How dissonant is each chord, based on the intervals it contains? Do particular intervals have particular effects?</li>
<li>Pay attention to the <em>melodic intervals</em> between successive notes in the melody. Do particular intervals have an expressive effect?</li>
<li>Pay attention to the intervals formed <em>between</em> the cello melody and the piano chords. Can you use consonance and dissonance to create a sense of tension and release?</li>
<li>You can use triads, but try to use at least some chords that are not triadic, chords that there is no name for.</li>
<li>You can be specific about rhythm and articulation if you want, or you can simply space the noteheads out on the page <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week8/freeNotation.pdf">like this</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you need access to music paper, you can easily print some out at <a href="https://www.blanksheetmusic.net/">blanksheetmusic.net</a>. <strong><em>Turn in the assignment by 10pm on Tuesday evening</em></strong> by e-mailing me a PDF of the score.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Final Project Ideas</strong> Send me, by e-mail, one or two ideas for your final project. What are you interested in composing? What will you need to learn to be able to complete your project?</p></li>
