<section>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Make your last assignment spatial</strong>: Using effects like echo, equalization, and reverb, as well as volume-based panning, add spatial elements to your last assignment. Turn in a final version of the piece by <strong><em>10pm on Sunday May 19th</em></strong></p></li>
<li><strong>Final Project Proposal</strong>: Your final project for Music 8 will be to write a somewhat more substantial composition. This can be an extension of one of the assignments, or it can be something totally different. The key requirements / goals for this project are:
<ul>
<li>It should be something that you consider to be music, and that you can convincingly argue is music. If you're inclined to do something more &quot;out there&quot; (which I would welcome!), take a look at some of these links for inspiration:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=fAxHlLK3Oyk">I Am Sitting In A Room</a> (for which you should definitely check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room">Wikipedia Article</a> to understand what's happening)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxsssRAB8bc">The Metaphysics of Notation</a></li>
<li>The Ursonata: <a href="http://www.costis.org/x/schwitters/ursonate.htm">score</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXtDkAnJx7o&amp;t=19s">performance</a>. Is this music? Poetry? Both? Neither?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QHfOuRrJB8">The difference between hearing and listening</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We should be able to hear it somehow. If you're writing for instruments, I strongly encourage you to either write for an instrument you play, for piano, flute or cello (for which I can find players), or for a friend who plays a different instrument.</li>
<li>There should be a &quot;score&quot; of some form. This could be traditional western music notation, or it could be something more adventurous, like a graphic score, or a series of instructions for how to produce the sound. If you're creating a piece of electronic music, you should be able to present, along with the music, a visual representation of the structure and material of the piece. E.g. refer to <a href="https://blogthehum.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/gyorgy-ligetis-artikulation-with-score-and-audio/">Ligeti's Artikulation</a>. This must be more than a screenshot of the software you're using.</li>
<li>Keep it manageable: it will essentially be a three-week project, so propose something that excites you, but that is realistic to finish in that time-frame.</li>
</ul>
By <strong><em>5pm on Sunday May 19th</em></strong>, I would like you to e-mail to me (attached as a PDF) a roughly 300-word proposal for your final project that addresses:
<ul>
<li>The inspirations for your project, preferably with one or two links</li>
<li>The sound materials you will use (or the instrument or ensemble you will write for)</li>
<li>The tools you will use to create the music. (Pencil and paper? A notation program? Audacity?)</li>
<li>How long will the piece be?</li>
<li>How are we going to hear the music? (e.g. who's performing it)</li>
<li>How are we going to see the music? (what will the score look like)</li>
<li>What do you need from me to help you complete the project?</li>
</ul></li>
