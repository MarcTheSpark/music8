<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reading:</strong> <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/Reading/shitty_drafts.pdf">&quot;Shitty First Drafts&quot;</a> from <em>Bird by Bird</em> by Anne Lamott. This is especially there for you if you're struggling with the composition exercise. <em>You do not need to send me a reading response for this reading (though I guess you're welcome to if you want...).</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Composition Assignment 1:</strong> Your first composition assignment will be to take two of the sounds that you found in last week's assignment and to develop them into a piece of music. The score is to take the form of a graph of the main expressive parameter for each instrument. Here are a couple of examples to give you a better sense of the assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Popsicle / Ruler&quot;: <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example1/PopsicleRuler.pdf">Score</a>, <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example1/PopsicleRulerDescription.pdf">Description</a>, <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example1/PopsicleRuler.mp3">Recording</a></li>
<li>&quot;Clicks and Whispers&quot;: <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example2/ClicksAndWhispers.pdf">Score</a>, <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example2/ClicksAndWhispersDescription.pdf">Description</a>, <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example2/ClicksAndWhispers.mp3">Recording</a>. Notice that here, the timing has been quantized to a grid, which is one option you have available.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've provided two manuscript templates for you, <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/PaperTemplates/ParameterDuetPaper.pdf">one of which suggests fluid timing</a>, and the <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/PaperTemplates/ParameterDuetPaperQuantized.pdf">other of which suggests quantized timing</a>. In addition, if one of the instruments you choose has a discrete range of variation, you can use horizontal lines to distiguish different sounds. For instance, a score for a cup that you hit in different places might <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/discreteExample.pdf">look like this</a>.</p>
A few other guidelines:
<ul>
<li>Along with the composition itself, turn in a short description of what your two instruments are and what parameter of sound you're manipulating for each instrument.</li>
<li>Give some indication on the score of how fast the music is supposed to go. For the unquantized version of the score, a good approach is to give an approximate number of seconds per system. For the quantized score, you can give a metronome marking for the beat.</li>
<li>Aim for the piece to be about 2 or 3 pages, but effort is more important than length.</li>
<li>If you want, you can make the graph of the parameter get thicker or thinner to express dynamics. I did this in one of my examples.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>ALTERNATE Composition Assignment 1:</strong> As an alternative for those of you who are interested in using more traditional notation, you can instead use parameter graphs as a guide for a solo instrumental composition. The work should be for a solo instrument, ideally one that you play yourself, and can take the form of <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example3TraditionalNotation.pdf">something like this</a>. If you're interested in taking this approach, come talk to me.</p></li>
