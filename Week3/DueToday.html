<li><p><strong>Composition Assignment 1:</strong> Your first composition assignment will be a study in gesture and counterpoint, written for two simple instruments that each vary in just one parameter of sound. The score is to take the form of a graph of the main expressive parameter for each instrument.</p>
<p>I've provided two manuscript templates for you, <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/PaperTemplates/ParameterDuetPaper.pdf">one of which suggests fluid timing</a>, and the <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/PaperTemplates/ParameterDuetPaperQuantized.pdf">other of which suggests quantized timing</a>.</p>
<p>You can use whatever kind of instruments you want. The simplest approach would be to have both instruments simply vary up and down in pitch, perhaps to be performed by two vocalists on the syllable &quot;zzz&quot;. Another variation would be to have one instrument vary in pitch, while the other varies in volume (perhaps to be performed by a &quot;drum roll&quot; on the top of a desk). If you want to get a bit more adventurous, you might try something like this, which uses some vocal sounds that vary in other parameters:</p>
<p>&quot;Clicks and Whispers&quot;: - <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example2/ClicksAndWhispers.pdf">Score</a> - <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example2/ClicksAndWhispersDescription.pdf">Description</a> - <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example2/ClicksAndWhispers.mp3">Recording</a></p>
<p>If you want to get really adventurous, you could turn everyday objects into makeshift instruments, for instance like this example:</p>
<p>&quot;Popsicle / Ruler&quot;: - <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example1/PopsicleRuler.pdf">Score</a> - <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example1/PopsicleRulerDescription.pdf">Description</a> - <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week3/CompositionAssignment1/Example1/PopsicleRuler.mp3">Recording</a></p>
<p>In summary of these options, <a href="https://i.imgflip.com/2y0v60.jpg">click here</a></p>
<p>The main idea here is to see what kind of variety you can get out of very limited means, and especially to explore the ways in which multiple strands of music can interact with one another. Also, don't be afraid to leave gaps between gestures! Often this helps the listener to make sense of the music. A few other guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Along with the composition itself, turn in a short description of what your two instruments are and what parameter of sound you're manipulating for each instrument.</li>
<li>Give some indication on the score of how fast the music is supposed to go. For the unquantized version of the score, a good approach is to give an approximate number of seconds per system. For the quantized score, you can give a metronome marking for the beat.</li>
<li>Aim for the piece to be about 2 or 3 pages, but effort is more important than length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please turn this assignment in by <strong>e-mailing me a PDF of the score by 10pm on Sunday, April 14th</strong>. Note that <strong>you do not need to make a recording</strong>. I provide the recordings above for reference.</p></li>
