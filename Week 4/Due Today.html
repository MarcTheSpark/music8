<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reading:</strong> &quot;Some Sound Observations&quot; by Pauline Oliveros. <em>Make note of at least four descriptions of sound that you found evocative, and find at least two things you didn't understand to ask a question about.</em> <strong>E-mail me these observations and questions by Tuesday at 5PM</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recording of Composition Assignment 1:</strong> Using Audacity (or a similar program if you have experience with another audio editor), make a recording of your piece from composition assignment 1. <em>E-mail me the recording in .ogg (or mp3) form by going to &quot;File&gt;Export&gt;Export as OGG&quot; in Audacity. Bring the score of your piece to class, and also send me a PDF of it.</em> (A tool that I like to use for making and sharing PDFs of handwritten documents is &quot;CamScanner&quot;, which you can find for both Apple and Android devices.)</p></li>
