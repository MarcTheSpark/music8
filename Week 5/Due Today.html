<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sound Recording Collection</strong>: Collect 8-12 recordings of sounds that you find interesting, either by recording them with your phone or portable recording device, or by downloading them from an online service such as <a href="https://freesound.org">freesound.org</a>. Try to have each recording contain just one single &quot;sound object&quot;, editing the files where necessary using a tool such as <em>Audacity</em>. Name each recording something simple that describes its contents, such as &quot;alarmclock.wav&quot;. <em>Place these sounds in a single folder with your name on it, compress the folder, and e-mail it to me as a downloadable link (e.g. from google drive, box, dropbox, wetransfer) by Sunday at 5pm.</em></p></li>
<li><p>If you're using an android phone, a good option for making a recording and emailing it to yourself is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.axet.audiorecorder">Audio Recorder</a>. (Use this link if possible, because there are many similarly named programs, and I think this is the best one.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sound Categorization</strong>: Using the template in &quot;Week 5/Listening Graph Templates/Scales.pdf&quot;, place each sound where you feel it belongs on the various scales given. For the last two, invent some properties of your own, such as &quot;sudden attack vs. gradual attack&quot; or &quot;stable vs. unstable&quot;. Having done this, use the template in &quot;Week 5/Listening Graph Templates/2D Graphs.pdf&quot; to compare how sounds relate based on two different properties. (You can reuse the same properties as before in the 1D scales.) <em>Bring these filled-out templates to class.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep in Mind</strong>: Just as before, your next assignment will be to turn these sounds into a composition, so make them interesting!</p></li>
