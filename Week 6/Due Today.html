<ul>
<li><strong>Composition Assignment 2</strong>: Compose a 1-2 minute piece by arranging, duplicating, combining and processing the sounds that you collected in last week's assignment. You may use Audacity or a different program if you have facility in something else. Try to have the sounds interact with one another in a meaningful way, and make use of space as one of your main compositional parameters. Use most of, if not all of the following:
<ul>
<li>Reverb</li>
<li>Echo</li>
<li>Left right panning using volume</li>
<li>Left right panning using timing</li>
<li>EQ</li>
</ul>
<p>Turn in the assignment by 10pm on Sunday evening by e-mailing me a (preferably compressed) rendering of the track.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start to think about what you might want to do for your final project.</strong> We will start to really look into this next week.</p></li>
</ul>
