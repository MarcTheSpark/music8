<li><p><strong>Reading:</strong> <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week4/Oliveros_Some-Sound-Observations.pdf">&quot;Some Sound Observations&quot; by Pauline Oliveros</a>. Please turn in a 150-200 word response to this reading (and to the material below) <strong>by 5pm on Sunday the 5th</strong>. This reading touches on a bunch of aspects of the nature of sound, many of which will not be familiar to you. That's why I would also like you to...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate some of the following quotes using the links given:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>&quot;During the quiet evening of a summer vacation near the Feather River Canyon, Lynn, Bob, and I wanted to play music. We decided to read John Cage's <em>Atlas Eclipticalis</em> from the original score, which was still shining brightly above&quot;
<ul>
<li>What is John Cage's <em>Atlas Eclipticalis</em>? (<a href="https://www.allmusic.com/composition/atlas-eclipticalis-for-orchestra-parts-for-86-musicians-mc0002390266">Read up on it here.</a>)</li>
<li>What does she mean by playing it from the original score?</li>
<li>Take a look at <a href="http://eclipticalis.com">this webpage</a>. It's fun.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;As I lean on my wooden table, my arm receives sympathetic vibrations from the low frequencies of the bulldozer&quot; ... &quot;7Hz at high intensity can make you sick or kill you&quot;
<ul>
<li>What are &quot;sympathetic vibrations&quot;? See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_resonance">this wikipedia page</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxRkOQmzLgo">take a look at this video</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyOUJUOUvso">This video</a> shows more or less the same thing at, just with pendulums connected by a spring, instead of tuning forks. Here, it's clear what is connecting the two pendulums, but in the case of the tuning forks, what is the medium connecting them?</li>
<li>With <a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=nFzu6CNtqec">this video</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)#Cause_of_the_collapse">Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse</a> in mind, how might 7Hz at high intensity make you sick?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Sitting in a parking lot on my third day of article writing, I could listen to the sterophony of car starter gagglings, motor wigglings, door squeals, and &quot;bllaps&quot; forever. It's almost like Debussy, compared to Saturday's Wagnerian bulldozer&quot;
<ul>
<li>What does she mean by &quot;stereophony&quot; here? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound">Read some of this</a></li>
<li>Why are the sounds like Debussy, why was the bulldozer Wagnerian? Take a listen <a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=43rzoDrD4e0">here</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/SF4zN-Okonc?t=2004">here</a>, and to other works of Debussy and Wagner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;A faraway jet simulates a fifty foot tabla, accompanied by an infinite freeway tamboura&quot;
<ul>
<li>See the wikipedia pages on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla">Tabla</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanpura">Tanpura</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XFxvhHwKi0">this sample of them playing together</a>.</li>
<li>Here's <a href="https://www.invidio.us/f4rYS_cugnE?t=448">an actual performance</a>. The Tanpura and Tabla players are the two furthest on the right.</li>
<li>What does she mean by this comparison? What does it say about the nature of the interaction of the sounds?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;When I was sixteen, my accordian teacher taught me to hear combination tones...&quot;
<ul>
<li>What are combination tones? <a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=KWJS_Fzs1j4">Watch this video and find out!</a></li>
<li>So how was she going about only hearing the combination tones?</li>
<li>Can you hear the melody that I hid in this <a href="http://www.marcevanstein.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/CombinationTones.ogg">horrible, horrible sound</a>?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An extra challenge, what's going on with this quote: &quot;Walking toward the theater, my footsteps greeted me from the approaching wall; midway, they followed me from the opposite wall&quot;.
<ul>
<li>This will require a bit more digging to understand, but it's and example of temporal masking, specifically applied to echos. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_masking#Temporal_masking">Take a look at the Wikipedia article.</a></li>
<li>Why would they approach from in front, and then come from behind?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another extra topic (look at the others first): &quot;Human hearing is non-linear. Our ears are less sensitive to low and high frequencies.&quot;
<ul>
<li>Take a look at the wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour">Equal Loudness Curves</a></li>
<li>Also take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_scale">the Bark Scale</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Make some recordings</strong>: Using your phone or other portable recording device, collect 8 recordings of sounds that you find interesting. Aim for as great a variety of sounds as possible, and try to have each recording contain just one single &quot;sound object&quot;, editing the files where necessary using a tool such as <em>Audacity</em>. Name each recording something simple that describes its contents, such as &quot;alarmclock.wav&quot;. <em>Place these sounds in a single folder with your name on it, compress the folder, and e-mail it to me as a downloadable link (e.g. from google drive, box, dropbox, wetransfer) by <strong>Sunday at 5pm.</strong></em></p></li>
