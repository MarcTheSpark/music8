<ul>
<li><p><strong>Composition Assignment 2</strong>: Using <a href="http://marcevansmusic.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week6/ExcerptsAboutMusicalSpace.pdf">this template</a>, write a work for three rhythmic instruments moving at different rates: a fast part operating at at the beat level, a medium-speed part operating at the measure level, and a slow part operating at the hypermeasure level. The resulting score should <a href="http://marcevansmusic.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week6/RhythmExerciseExample.pdf">look something like this</a>, which would correspond to <a href="http://marcevansmusic.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week6/RhythmExerciseExample.ogg">something sounding like this</a>. <em>E-mail me a PDF of the score by</em> <strong><em>Tuesday at 5pm</em></strong>. You do NOT need to make a recording of this (unless you really want to).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Space!:</strong> Read through <a href="http://marcevansmusic.com/OtherStuff/Music8Materials/Week6/ExcerptsAboutMusicalSpace.pdf">these excerpts</a> about the use of space and spatial cues in music. We are going to be looking at them more closely in class, but it's important that you've looked through them beforehand so that you're not seeing them for the first time. Don't worry if some of the vocabulary is unfamiliar or if the wording is confusing; just make a note of anything you don't understand. You don't need to send me a reading response.</p></li>
